Adding header authorization to a CURL request is a common task when interacting with APIs that require authentication. Here are user-centric instructions to help you achieve this:

**Step 1: Understand the Basics**

Before we dive into the instructions, make sure you have a basic understanding of:

* What a CURL request is (a command-line tool for transferring data to and from a web server)
* What an API is (a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other)
* What authentication is (the process of verifying the identity of a user or system)

**Step 2: Gather Required Information**

To add header authorization to your CURL request, you'll need the following information:

* The API endpoint URL (the address of the API you want to interact with)
* The authentication token or credentials (e.g., username, password, API key, or access token)
* The type of authentication required (e.g., Basic Auth, Bearer Token, or OAuth)

**Step 3: Construct the CURL Request**

Open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:
```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://api.example.com/endpoint \
  -H 'Authorization: <AUTH_TYPE> <AUTH_TOKEN>'
```
Replace:

* `https://api.example.com/endpoint` with the API endpoint URL
* `<AUTH_TYPE>` with the type of authentication required (e.g., `Basic`, `Bearer`, or `OAuth`)
* `<AUTH_TOKEN>` with the authentication token or credentials

**Examples:**

* Basic Auth: `curl -X GET https://api.example.com/endpoint -H 'Authorization: Basic <base64 encoded username:password>'`
* Bearer Token: `curl -X GET https://api.example.com/endpoint -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'`
* OAuth: `curl -X GET https://api.example.com/endpoint -H 'Authorization: OAuth <access_token>'`

Certainly! Adding header authorization to a `curl` request is a common task when you need to authenticate your requests to an API or web service. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

### Step 1: Identify the Authorization Type
First, determine the type of authorization required by the API. Common types include:
- **Basic Authentication**: Uses a username and password.
- **Bearer Token**: Uses a token (often obtained from an authentication service).
- **API Key**: Uses a key that is often passed in the header.

### Step 2: Prepare the Authorization Value
Depending on the type of authorization, prepare the value accordingly:
- **Basic Authentication**:
  - Combine your username and password into a single string separated by a colon, e.g., `username:password`.
  - Encode this string using Base64.
  - The authorization header will look like: `Authorization: Basic <base64_encoded_string>`.

- **Bearer Token**:
  - Use the token directly.
  - The authorization header will look like: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

- **API Key**:
  - Use the API key directly.
  - The authorization header will look like: `Authorization: ApiKey <api_key>`.

### Step 3: Construct the `curl` Command
Now, construct the `curl` command with the appropriate authorization header.

#### Example 1: Basic Authentication
```sh
curl -u username:password https://example.com/api/resource
```
Alternatively, you can use the `-H` option to add the header manually:
```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'username:password' | base64)" https://example.com/api/resource
```

#### Example 2: Bearer Token
```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" https://example.com/api/resource
```

#### Example 3: API Key

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Identify the API endpoint you want to send the CURL request to. This is usually a URL provided by the API documentation.

3. Determine the type of authorization required by the API. This is usually found in the API documentation as well. Common types include "Basic", "Bearer", and "Token".

4. Obtain your authorization token or credentials. This could be a token you received after logging in, or your username and password for Basic authorization.

5. For Basic authorization, you'll need to encode your username and password. You can do this in the terminal with the following command: `echo -n 'username:password' | base64` (replace 'username:password' with your actual username and password). This will output an encoded string.

6. Now, you can construct your CURL command. Start with the basic structure: `curl -X <HTTP_METHOD> <API_ENDPOINT>`. Replace `<HTTP_METHOD>` with the HTTP method you want to use (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and replace `<API_ENDPOINT>` with the API endpoint you identified in step 2.

7. Add the header authorization to your CURL command. If you're using Basic authorization, use the encoded string from step 5. The header should look like this: `-H 'Authorization: Basic <ENCODED_STRING>'`. If you're using a different type of authorization, replace 'Basic' with the appropriate type (like 'Bearer' or 'Token').

8. Your final CURL command might look something like this: `curl -X GET -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' <API_ENDPOINT>`.
